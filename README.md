# A project created to improve skills in the python language and the use of a local database. The problem I had to solve was to randomise words in such a way that they do not repeat, in addition to the fact that in each run of the program the word we mark as known occurs only once. In addition, the application needed to be synchronised with the current state of the database.

**Technologies used:**
+ Application written in **python**
+ tkinter library responsible for GUI of the application
+ MySQL Connector library for connecting to the local database
+ Creation of the necessary database using MySQL Workbench
